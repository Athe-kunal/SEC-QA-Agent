No sentence-transformers model found with name /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert. Creating a new one with MEAN pooling.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert were not used when initializing BertModel: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

Relevant documents for GOOGL in the year 2022 : Alphabet's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.
 The Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people and businesses large and small.
 Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998.Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google.
 We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets.
 Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business.
 We take a long-term view and manage the portfolio of Other Bets with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns.Alphabet’s investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes emerging businesses at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term.
 While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries.To accelerate the transition to a carbon-free economy, in 2020, we launched our third decade of climate action, and we are now working toward a new set of ambitious goals.To accelerate the transition to a circular economy, we are working to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same.
 We are also working to empower everyone with technology by committing to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by the end of 2022 through our core products.By 2030, we aim to: achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain; become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year; enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions; and help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually.For additional information, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
