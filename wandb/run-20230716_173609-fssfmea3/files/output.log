No sentence-transformers model found with name /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert. Creating a new one with MEAN pooling.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert were not used when initializing BertModel: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

I apologize, but I don't have access to the relevant documents to provide an accurate answer to your questions about the risks involved in GOOGL for the years 2021 and 2022. As an AI language model, my responses are based on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data. I don't have real-time access to financial statements or the ability to browse the internet. Therefore, I recommend referring to the latest financial reports, news articles, or consulting with a financial analyst for the most up-to-date and accurate information regarding the risks associated with GOOGL.
