Credit Risk and Investment Fluctuations: Both in 2021 and 2022, Apple is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. Changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations, or other factors can negatively affect the value and liquidity of Apple's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities.\n\n2. Sales Performance: In 2021, Apple experienced increased net sales in Mac, iPad, and Wearables, Home, and Accessories categories. This growth was primarily driven by higher net sales of MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, iPad Air, iPad Pro, accessories, and Apple Watch. However, in 2022, while Mac and Wearables, Home, and Accessories net sales continued to increase, iPad net sales decreased primarily due to lower net sales of iPad Pro.\n\n3. Services Gross Margin: In 2021, Apple's Services gross margin percentage increased compared to 2020. This improvement was attributed to a different Services mix and improved leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs. However, the company acknowledges that future gross margins can be impacted by various factors, leading to volatility and downward pressure.\n\n4. Business Strategies and Acquisitions: Apple has invested and may continue to invest in new business strategies or acquisitions. This indicates a potential risk associated with the success and profitability of these investments.\n\n5. Stock Repurchases and Dividends: In 2022, Apple repurchased a significant amount of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents. This information suggests that the company is actively managing its capital structure and returning value to shareholders.\n\n6. Impact of COVID-19: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on businesses worldwide, including Apple. The measures taken to control the pandemic, such as travel restrictions, business closures, and quarantine orders, have affected Apple's operations. This ongoing risk may continue to impact the company's financial performance.\n\n7. Competitive Landscape: Apple has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, and tablet markets. This indicates a competitive risk, as the company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected if it fails to develop and sell innovative products or if competitors infringe on its intellectual property.\n\nIt is important to note that the provided documents do not explicitly compare and contrast the risks associated with Apple stocks in 2021 and 2022.
