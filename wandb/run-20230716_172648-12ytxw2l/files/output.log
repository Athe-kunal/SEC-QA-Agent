No sentence-transformers model found with name /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert. Creating a new one with MEAN pooling.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert were not used when initializing BertModel: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

Question: Apple in 2022
Answer: In 2022, Apple experienced an increase in total net sales of 8% or $28.5 billion compared to 2021. This growth was primarily driven by higher net sales of iPhone, Services, and Mac. Mac net sales increased due to higher sales of laptops, while iPad net sales decreased primarily due to lower sales of iPad Pro. Wearables, Home, and Accessories net sales increased primarily due to higher sales of Apple Watch and AirPods. Services net sales also increased, driven by higher sales from advertising, cloud services, and the App Store. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during 2022.
Question: Apple in 2021
Answer: In 2021, Apple saw an increase in Mac net sales compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher sales of MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and iMac. iPad net sales also increased compared to 2020, primarily due to higher sales of iPad Air and iPad Pro. Wearables, Home, and Accessories net sales increased, driven by higher sales of accessories and Apple Watch. Additionally, iPhone net sales increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the launch of new iPhone models and a favorable mix of iPhone sales.
