statements\u201d).\nThese costs are allocated to segments based on usage.\n The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings.\nWe also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to \u201cCost of sales\u201d predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content.\n The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.\n6 years.\n Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships.\nDuring 2020, we acquired certain companies for

2021, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $496 million, net of cash acquired.\n The primary reason for all acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.\nWe provided guidance on February\u00a03, 2022, in our earnings release furnished on Form\u00a08-K as set forth below.\n These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.\ncom\u2019s expectations as of February\u00a03, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nWe expect our International sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021.\n Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $1.\n7 billion and $3.\n0 billion in 2020 and 2021.\n AWS sales increased 37% in 2021, compared to the prior year.\n The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes.\n1 billion and $46.\n3 billion in 2020 and 2021.\n Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products

long-term liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.\n9 billion and $2.\n2 billion of unearned revenue as of December\u00a031, 2020 and 2021.\n Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements.\n For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $80.\n3 billion and $2.\n6 billion as of December\u00a031, 2020 and 2021.\n We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers\u2019 programs.\n Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and

measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December\u00a031, 2020, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $270\u00a0million.\n

commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n We are subject to income taxes in the U.\nS.\nRevenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\n Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services.\n Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand.\nWe dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\n Beginning in March 2020, a number of class-action complaints were filed alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.\ncom, Inc.\n and third-party sellers in Amazon\u2019s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization of an alleged market in online retail or other submarkets, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims.\n In March 2020,

furnished on Form\u00a08-K as set forth below.\n These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.\ncom\u2019s expectations as of February\u00a02, 2021, and are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\n The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees.\nDuring 2020, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $1.\n2 billion, net of cash acquired, of which $1.\n1 billion was capitalized to in-process research and development intangible assets (\u201cIPR&D\u201d).\n The primary reason for all acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.\n Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(2.\n4) billion and $1.\n7 billion
