Base your answer only on the following relevant documentss: \n\n    Relevant documents for AAPL in the year 2022 : The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements.Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n Future operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meetBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks.\n Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\n The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.\nS.demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies.Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.\nS.\n, Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products.\n Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services.In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management.\n While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution.\n Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions.S.\n Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations.\n Changes or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties.Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all.While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.\nS.The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201c The Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, \u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and priceTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\n \n\n\n\n    Answer the list of user questions ['Apple 2022 ESG spending initiatives'], answer each question separately from the relevant
