No sentence-transformers model found with name /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert. Creating a new one with MEAN pooling.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert were not used when initializing BertModel: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

Relevant documents for GOOGL in the year 2021 : In addition, COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy has impacted and may continue to adversely impact our revenue growth rate (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below).These developments create some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or harm the operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business.
 We face, and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products, including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings, we also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation.
 We may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental impacts, or service disruptions or failures.We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.
 Some of the areas where we face risks include: Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
 Failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology.Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below), have impacted the demand for advertising and resulted in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, and could have an adverse impact on such demand and spend, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
 We face intense competition.Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adversely affect our business and financial results.
 Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.In addition, COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy has impacted and may continue to adversely impact our revenue growth rate (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below).Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products, including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings, we also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation.
