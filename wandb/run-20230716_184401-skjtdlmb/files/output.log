No sentence-transformers model found with name /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert. Creating a new one with MEAN pooling.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert were not used when initializing BertModel: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

Relevant documents for AAPL in the year 2022 : Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.
I apologize, but I couldn't find the specific risk factors section for Apple in the year 2022 in the provided documents. However, based on the relevant document, it mentions that the actual future gains and losses associated with Apple's investment portfolio, debt, and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed. This is due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and the company's actual exposures and positions.
