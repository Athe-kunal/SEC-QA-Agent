No sentence-transformers model found with name /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert. Creating a new one with MEAN pooling.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert were not used when initializing BertModel: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

I apologize, but I don't have access to the specific content of the relevant documents you mentioned. However, I can provide you with some general information about risk factors for Apple and Google based on their annual reports and other publicly available information.
For Apple in 2022, some potential risk factors could include:
1. Market competition: Apple faces intense competition in the technology industry, particularly in the smartphone, tablet, and computer markets. Increased competition could impact Apple's market share and profitability.
2. Global economic conditions: Economic downturns or uncertainties in key markets could affect consumer spending on Apple products, leading to lower sales and revenue.
3. Supply chain disruptions: Apple relies on a complex global supply chain, and any disruptions in the availability of components or manufacturing processes could impact product availability and financial performance.
4. Regulatory and legal challenges: Apple operates in multiple jurisdictions and is subject to various laws and regulations. Changes in regulations or legal challenges related to areas such as privacy, intellectual property, or antitrust could have a significant impact on Apple's business operations.
For Apple in 2021, the same risk factors mentioned above could still be relevant, but the specific impact and developments would depend on the events and circumstances of that year.
Regarding Google, similar risk factors could apply. However, it's important to note that Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., and its financial information is typically reported as part of Alphabet's consolidated financial statements. Therefore, the risk factors for Google would generally align with those of Alphabet Inc.
Please note that the specific risk factors for Apple and Google in the mentioned years may not be available in the provided documents. It is always recommended to refer to the companies' official financial statements, annual reports, and other relevant disclosures for the most accurate and up-to-date information on their risk factors.
