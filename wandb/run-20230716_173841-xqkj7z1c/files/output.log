No sentence-transformers model found with name /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert. Creating a new one with MEAN pooling.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at /home/athekunal/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/ProsusAI_finbert were not used when initializing BertModel: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

Relevant documents for GOOGL in the year 2022 : 3 billion lower as of December31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
 The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.
 We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries.
 These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations.9 billion and $7.
8 billion of our investments as of December31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
 A hypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2021 balance, which could be experienced in the near term, would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $780 million.
 From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.
I'm sorry, but based on the provided relevant documents, I don't have information about the risks involved for Google in the year 2022.
